# ðŸ”§ Campaign Creation Fix - v2.4.1

## Problem Identified
The `create_campaign` endpoint was returning a **400 Bad Request** error when users tried to create campaigns. The error was caused by:

1. **Placeholder Email Validation**: The example used `your-verified-email@example.com` which is not a real verified account
2. **Missing Guidance**: Users didn't know they needed to use actual verified sending accounts
3. **Poor Error Messages**: Generic 400 errors without helpful guidance

## Root Cause Analysis
Looking at the API request that failed:
```json
{
  "email_list": ["your-verified-email@example.com"],
  "name": "My First Campaign",
  "subject": "Introduction to Our Services",
  "body": "Hi {{firstName}}...",
  // ... other fields
}
```

The issue was that `your-verified-email@example.com` is a placeholder, not an actual verified sending account in the user's Instantly workspace.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Validation
Added comprehensive validation to catch common mistakes:

```typescript
// Check for placeholder emails that won't work
const placeholderEmails = ['your-verified-email@example.com', 'example@example.com', 'test@example.com'];
const hasPlaceholder = args.email_list.some((email: string) => placeholderEmails.includes(email.toLowerCase()));
if (hasPlaceholder) {
  throw new McpError(ErrorCode.InvalidParams, 
    'email_list contains placeholder email addresses. Please use actual verified sending accounts from your Instantly account. ' +
    'You can check your verified accounts by running the list_accounts tool first.'
  );
}
```

### 2. Improved Error Messages
Instead of generic "400 Bad Request", users now get helpful messages like:
- "email_list contains placeholder email addresses. Please use actual verified sending accounts..."
- "You can check your verified accounts by running the list_accounts tool first"
- Clear guidance on next steps

### 3. Email Format Validation
Added validation to catch invalid email formats before sending to API.

### 4. Confirmed API Compliance
Verified that all required fields (like `sequences`) are properly included in the request.

## How to Use the Fixed Version

### Step 1: Update to Latest Version
```bash
npx instantly-mcp@latest
```

### Step 2: Get Your Verified Accounts
```bash
# First, check what verified sending accounts you have
list_accounts
```

### Step 3: Create Campaign with Real Accounts
```bash
create_campaign {
  "name": "My Campaign",
  "subject": "Hello!",
  "body": "Hi {{firstName}}, ...",
  "email_list": ["your-actual-verified@email.com"]  # Use real verified account
}
```

## Testing the Fix
A test script is included (`test-campaign-fix.ts`) that validates:
- âœ… Placeholder email rejection
- âœ… Missing email_list validation  
- âœ… Email format validation
- âœ… Helpful error messages

## Version History
- **v2.4.0**: Initial comprehensive API implementation
- **v2.4.1**: ðŸ”§ **HOTFIX** - Fixed campaign creation validation and error messages

## Next Steps for Users
1. Run `list_accounts` to see your verified sending accounts

3. Campaign creation should now work successfully!
