## ðŸš€ **OPTION 1: RAILWAY DEPLOYMENT (RECOMMENDED)**

### **Step 1: One-Command Deploy**
```bash
# Set your API key
export INSTANTLY_API_KEY="your_api_key_here"

# Deploy to Railway
./deploy-staging.sh
```

**That's it!** The script will:
- âœ… Install Railway CLI if needed
- âœ… Create and deploy project
- âœ… Set environment variables
- âœ… Run comprehensive tests
- âœ… Provide staging URL

### **Step 2: Get Your URL**
After deployment, you'll get a URL like:
```
https://instantly-mcp-staging-production.up.railway.app
```

### **Step 3: Test Immediately**
```bash
# Quick health check
curl https://your-staging-url.railway.app/health

# Test MCP endpoint
curl -X POST https://your-staging-url.railway.app/mcp \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "x-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"tools/list","params":{}}'
```

## ðŸš€ **OPTION 2: MANUAL RAILWAY SETUP**

### **Step 1: Install Railway CLI**
```bash
npm install -g @railway/cli
railway login
```

### **Step 2: Deploy**
```bash
# Build project
npm run build

# Create Railway project
railway new instantly-mcp-staging

# Set environment variables
railway variables set INSTANTLY_API_KEY="your_api_key"
railway variables set NODE_ENV=production
railway variables set TRANSPORT_MODE=http

# Deploy
railway up
```

### **Step 3: Test**
```bash
# Get your URL
railway domain

# Run tests
STAGING_URL="https://your-url.railway.app" node test-staging-environment.js
```

## ðŸš€ **OPTION 3: RENDER DEPLOYMENT**

### **Step 1: Connect Repository**
1. Go to [render.com](https://render.com)
2. Connect your GitHub repository
3. Choose "Web Service"

### **Step 2: Configure**
- **Build Command**: `npm run build`
- **Start Command**: `npm run start:production`
- **Environment Variables**:
  ```
  NODE_ENV=production
  TRANSPORT_MODE=http
  INSTANTLY_API_KEY=your_api_key
  ```

### **Step 3: Deploy & Test**
Render will provide a URL like `https://instantly-mcp.onrender.com`

## ðŸ§ª **INSTANT TESTING**

### **1. Health Check (30 seconds)**
```bash
curl https://your-staging-url/health
# Expected: {"status":"healthy","service":"instantly-mcp"}
```

### **2. Tools List (1 minute)**
```bash
curl -X POST https://your-staging-url/mcp \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "x-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"tools/list","params":{}}'
# Expected: 22 tools listed
```

### **3. Tool Execution (2 minutes)**
```bash
curl -X POST https://your-staging-url/mcp \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "x-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -d '{
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "id": 2,
    "method": "tools/call",
    "params": {
      "name": "list_accounts",
      "arguments": {"get_all": true}
    }
  }'
# Expected: Account data returned
```

### **4. Comprehensive Test Suite (5 minutes)**
```bash
STAGING_URL="https://your-staging-url" \
INSTANTLY_API_KEY="your_api_key" \
node test-staging-environment.js
```

## ðŸ“ž **INSTANT SUPPORT**

### **If Something Goes Wrong:**

#### **Deployment Issues**
```bash
# Check Railway logs
railway logs

# Check build status
railway status

# Redeploy
railway up --detach
```

#### **API Issues**
```bash
# Test health first
curl https://your-url/health

# Check API key
echo $INSTANTLY_API_KEY

# Test without auth (should fail)
curl -X POST https://your-url/mcp \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"tools/list"}'
```

#### **Performance Issues**
```bash
# Check response time
time curl https://your-url/health

# Monitor logs
railway logs --tail
```

## ðŸš€ **NEXT STEPS AFTER SUCCESS**

### **1. Share with Instantly.ai Team**
```markdown
âœ… Staging URL: https://your-staging-url.railway.app
âœ… All tests passing
âœ… Ready for production deployment
âœ… See INSTANTLY-TEAM-HANDOFF.md for details
```

### **2. Prepare for Production**
- Domain configuration: `instantly.ai/mcp`
- SSL certificate setup
- Production API key
- Monitoring configuration

### **3. Go Live**
Once Instantly.ai team configures DNS:
```bash
# Test production endpoint
curl https://instantly.ai/health
curl -X POST https://instantly.ai/mcp \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "x-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"tools/list","params":{}}'
```
