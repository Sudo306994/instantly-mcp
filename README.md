## Quick Start

### Using with npx (no installation required)

Add to your MCP settings configuration:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "instantly": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["instantly-mcp", "--api-key", "YOUR_INSTANTLY_API_KEY"]
    }
  }
}
```

### Local Installation

1. Clone and install:
```bash
npm install
npm run build
```

2. Add to your MCP settings:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "instantly": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/path/to/instantly-mcp/dist/index.js", "--api-key", "YOUR_INSTANTLY_API_KEY"]
    }
  }
}
```

## Getting Your API Key

1. Log in to [Instantly.ai](https://app.instantly.ai)
2. Navigate to Settings > Integrations > API
3. Generate or copy your API key

## Remote HTTP Deployment

The MCP server can be deployed remotely for use with cloud-based AI assistants. It supports two authentication methods:

### 1. Header-based Authentication (Recommended)

**Endpoint**: `https://mcp.instantly.ai/mcp`

Use any of these header formats:
```bash
# Bearer token (recommended)
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_INSTANTLY_API_KEY

# Custom header
x-instantly-api-key: YOUR_INSTANTLY_API_KEY

# Legacy header
x-api-key: YOUR_INSTANTLY_API_KEY
```

### 2. URL-based Authentication

**Endpoint**: `https://mcp.instantly.ai/mcp/{API_KEY}`

Example: `https://mcp.instantly.ai/mcp/your-instantly-api-key-here`

### Digital Ocean Deployment

Deploy to Digital Ocean App Platform:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/bcharleson/Instantly-MCP.git
cd Instantly-MCP
git checkout streamable-http-overhaul

# Deploy to Digital Ocean
./deploy-digitalocean.sh
```

See [DIGITAL-OCEAN-DEPLOYMENT.md](DIGITAL-OCEAN-DEPLOYMENT.md) for detailed deployment instructions.

### Local HTTP Testing

## üöÄ Pagination Improvements

### **Bulletproof Pagination Across All Tools**

All list operations now use **bulletproof pagination** that automatically retrieves complete datasets:

#### **‚úÖ Enhanced Tools:**
- **`list_accounts`** - Retrieves ALL accounts (no more 100-account limit)
- **`list_campaigns`** - Retrieves ALL campaigns with filters
- **`list_emails`** - Retrieves ALL emails with filters
- **`list_leads`** - Maintains existing offset-based pagination

#### **üéØ Key Benefits:**

**Complete Data Retrieval:**
```
BEFORE: list_accounts() ‚Üí First 100 accounts only
AFTER:  list_accounts() ‚Üí ALL accounts in workspace
```

**Consistent Behavior:**
```
BEFORE: starting_after parameter ‚Üí Single page response
AFTER:  starting_after parameter ‚Üí ALL data from that point
```

**Enhanced create_campaign Workflow:**
- Now sees ALL available accounts for selection
- Better decision making with complete account data
- Enhanced verified_accounts array with full dataset

#### **üõ°Ô∏è Safety Features:**
- **Rate Limiting**: Respects API limits with intelligent pacing
- **Memory Efficient**: Streaming approach for large datasets
- **Error Recovery**: Graceful handling of API issues
- **Progress Monitoring**: Detailed logging for large operations

#### **üìä Response Format:**
```json
{
  "data": [...],
  "total_retrieved": 250,
  "pagination_method": "bulletproof_complete",
  "pagination_info": "Retrieved ALL 250 accounts through bulletproof pagination",
  "starting_after_support": "Started from beginning",
  "success_metrics": {
    "api_calls_made": 3,
    "records_per_call": 100,
    "pagination_bug_fixed": true,
    "complete_dataset": true,
    "no_duplicates": true
  }
}
```

#### **üîß Usage Examples:**
```bash
# Get all accounts
list_accounts()

# Get all accounts starting from specific point
list_accounts(starting_after="account-id-100")

# Get all campaigns with filters
list_campaigns(search="Q2", status="active")

# Get all emails for specific campaign
list_emails(campaign_id="campaign-123")
```

## Development

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run in development mode
npm run dev -- --api-key YOUR_API_KEY

# Build for production
