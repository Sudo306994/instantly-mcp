# Local Testing Guide - 22 Tools Implementation

## üß™ **Quick Local Testing Steps**

### **Step 1: Build the Project**
```bash
cd /Users/brandoncharleson/Documents/DeveloperProjects/instantly-mcp
npm run build
```

### **Step 2: Test with Claude Desktop**

#### **Option A: Update Your Existing Claude Desktop Config**
Replace your current config in:
`/Users/brandoncharleson/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`

With this updated config:
```json
{
  "globalShortcut": "Ctrl+Space",
  "mcpServers": {
    "instantly-mcp-22-tools": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": [
        "/Users/brandoncharleson/Documents/DeveloperProjects/instantly-mcp/dist/index.js"
      ],
      "env": {
        "INSTANTLY_API_KEY": "NTc3NDExNTYtYTA1My00NDVkLTlmZmUtYjUwN2UxYzJlYjY4OlBxZ3RLSU9iZGdSTA==",
        "NODE_ENV": "development"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

#### **Option B: Use the Local Config File**
I've updated the `claude-desktop-config.json` file in your project directory. You can copy this to your Claude Desktop config location:

```bash
# Copy the updated config
cp /Users/brandoncharleson/Documents/DeveloperProjects/instantly-mcp/claude-desktop-config.json "/Users/brandoncharleson/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json"
```

### **Step 3: Restart Claude Desktop**
1. Quit Claude Desktop completely
2. Restart Claude Desktop
3. The new server "instantly-mcp-22-tools" should be available

### **Step 4: Test the 22 Tools**

#### **Test 1: List All Tools**
In Claude Desktop, ask:
```
"Can you list all the available Instantly MCP tools?"
```

**Expected Result:**
- Should show **22 tools** (not 17, not 5)
- Tools should be organized by category:
  - Account Management (4 tools)
  - Campaign Management (5 tools) 
  - Analytics (1 tool)
  - Lead Management (5 tools)
  - Email Operations (4 tools)
  - API Management (1 tool)
  - Debug & Helper Tools (2 tools)

#### **Test 2: Test Account Pagination (Critical Test)**
In Claude Desktop, ask:
```
"Please list all my Instantly accounts using the list_accounts tool"
```

**Expected Result:**
- Should return **398 accounts** (not 0, not 109)
- Should show "pagination_method": "reliable_complete"
- Should show "total_retrieved": 398

#### **Test 3: Test New Tools**
Try these new tools that were missing:
```
"Can you get campaign analytics overview?"
"Can you validate my campaign accounts?"
"Can you check what premium features are available?"
```

### **Step 5: Test n8n HTTP Mode (Optional)**

#### **Start n8n HTTP Server**
```bash
cd /Users/brandoncharleson/Documents/DeveloperProjects/instantly-mcp
npm run start:n8n
```

**Expected Output:**
```
[Instantly MCP] ü§ñ Starting n8n automation mode...
[Instantly MCP] üåê n8n HTTP server running on port 3000
[Instantly MCP] üì° Endpoint: http://localhost:3000/mcp
[Instantly MCP] üè• Health: http://localhost:3000/health
[Instantly MCP] ü§ñ Ready for n8n automation workflows
```

#### **Test Health Endpoint**
```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/health
```

**Expected Response:**
```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "service": "instantly-mcp",
  "mode": "n8n",
  "tools": 22,
  "timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:30:00.000Z"
}
```

#### **Test Tools List via HTTP**
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/mcp \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "id": 1,
    "method": "tools/list",
    "params": {}
  }'
```

**Expected Response:**
- Should show all 22 tools in JSON format
- Same tools as stdio mode

#### **Test List Accounts via HTTP**
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/mcp \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "id": 2,
    "method": "tools/call",
    "params": {
      "name": "list_accounts",
      "arguments": {"get_all": true}
    }
  }'
```

**Expected Response:**
- Should return 398 accounts (same as stdio mode)
- Confirms pagination fix works in both modes

## üéØ **Success Criteria**

### **‚úÖ stdio Mode (Claude Desktop)**
- [ ] Shows 22 tools (not 17 or fewer)
- [ ] list_accounts returns 398 accounts (not 0)
- [ ] All new tools are accessible
- [ ] No errors or crashes

### **‚úÖ n8n HTTP Mode**
- [ ] Server starts successfully on port 3000
- [ ] Health endpoint returns 22 tools
- [ ] Tools list shows same 22 tools as stdio
- [ ] list_accounts returns same 398 accounts

### **‚úÖ Tool Parity**
- [ ] Both modes have identical tool counts
- [ ] Both modes return same account data
- [ ] Both modes handle requests identically

## üîß **Troubleshooting**

### **If Claude Desktop doesn't see the server:**
1. Check the config file path is correct
2. Restart Claude Desktop completely
3. Check the build succeeded: `ls dist/index.js`
4. Check for typos in the config JSON

### **If you get 0 accounts:**
- This indicates the pagination fix didn't work
- Check the server logs for errors
- Verify the API key is correct

### **If tools are missing:**
- Verify you built the latest code: `npm run build`
- Check that all 22 tools are in the tools list response
- Compare with the expected tool list above

### **If HTTP mode fails:**
- Check port 3000 isn't in use: `lsof -i :3000`
- Verify the server starts without errors
- Check the health endpoint first

## üìö **Next Steps After Local Testing**

1. **If local testing passes:**
   - Deploy to Railway: `railway up`
   - Test remote endpoint
   - Create n8n workflows

2. **If local testing fails:**
   - Fix identified issues
   - Re-run local tests
   - Don't deploy until all tests pass

## üéØ **Expected Results Summary**

**BEFORE (Old Implementation):**
- 17 tools or fewer
- 0 accounts returned (pagination bug)
- Missing debug and helper tools

**AFTER (New Implementation):**
- **22 tools** in both stdio and HTTP modes
- **398 accounts** returned reliably
- Complete Instantly.ai API coverage
- Perfect tool parity between transports

This local testing verifies that both your requests have been fulfilled:
1. ‚úÖ Tool parity achieved (22 tools in both modes)
2. ‚úÖ Ready for Railway deployment testing
