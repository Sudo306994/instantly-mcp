# 🧪 Testing Summary - Instantly MCP Server v3.0.1

## **Testing Approach Created**

I've created a comprehensive testing framework for the Instantly MCP Server v3.0.1 that addresses all the issues we identified and fixed. Here's what's ready for you to execute:

### **📋 Testing Assets Created**

1. **`test-mcp-v3.0.1.sh`** - Automated comprehensive test script
2. **`MANUAL_TESTING_GUIDE.md`** - Step-by-step manual testing instructions
3. **`TESTING_SUMMARY.md`** - This summary document

### **🎯 Key Testing Focus Areas**

#### **1. Verification of Fixes**
- ✅ **create_campaign 400 Error**: Test if resolved with proper email addresses
- ✅ **send_email 404 Error**: Verify `reply_to_email` replacement works
- ✅ **verify_email 403 Error**: Confirm if still requires premium/scopes

#### **2. Tool Registration Verification**
- ✅ **reply_to_email**: New tool properly registered
- ❌ **send_email**: Removed tool no longer appears
- ❌ **campaign_creation_wizard**: Removed wizard no longer appears

#### **3. Streamlined Workflow Testing**
- **Step 1**: `list_accounts` → Get 10 high-warmup accounts (98-100 scores)
- **Step 2**: `create_campaign` → Use exact email addresses from Step 1
- **Validation**: Confirm 2-step workflow works without wizard

## **🚀 How to Execute Testing**

### **Option 1: Automated Testing (Recommended)**
```bash
# Make script executable
chmod +x test-mcp-v3.0.1.sh

# Run comprehensive tests
./test-mcp-v3.0.1.sh YOUR_API_KEY

# Review detailed output and success rate
```

### **Option 2: Manual Testing**
```bash
# Follow step-by-step guide
cat MANUAL_TESTING_GUIDE.md

# Execute each test individually
npx instantly-mcp@3.0.1 --api-key YOUR_API_KEY
```

## **📊 Expected Test Results**

### **Should PASS (Previously Working)**
- ✅ `list_accounts` - 10 accounts with 98-100 warmup scores
- ✅ `list_campaigns` - Campaign listing functionality
- ✅ `create_lead_list` - Lead list creation
- ✅ `create_lead` - Lead creation with sample data
- ✅ `get_campaign_analytics_overview` - Analytics (12 replies, 4 opportunities)
- ✅ `list_api_keys` - API key listing (8 keys)

### **Should PASS (Now Fixed)**
- ✅ `create_campaign` - With exact emails from `list_accounts`
- ✅ `reply_to_email` - New implementation using `/emails/reply`
- ✅ Tool registration - `reply_to_email` present, `send_email` absent

### **May Still FAIL (Identified Issues)**
- ❌ `verify_email` - 403 Forbidden (premium feature/scope issue)
- ❌ `create_campaign` - If API key lacks `campaigns:create` scope

## **🔍 Critical Test Cases**

### **Test Case 1: Campaign Creation Workflow**
```bash
# Step 1: Get accounts
list_accounts {"limit": 100}

# Step 2: Use exact email from response
create_campaign {
  "name": "MCP Test Campaign v3.0.1",
  "subject": "Test email from MCP server", 
  "body": "This is a test email to verify the MCP server is working correctly.",
  "email_list": ["EXACT_EMAIL_FROM_STEP_1"]
}
```

**Expected**: ✅ Campaign created successfully (400 error resolved)

### **Test Case 2: Email Reply Functionality**
```bash
# Step 1: Get emails
list_emails {"limit": 5}

# Step 2: Reply to email
reply_to_email {
  "reply_to_uuid": "EMAIL_ID_FROM_STEP_1",
  "eaccount": "YOUR_ACCOUNT_EMAIL",
  "subject": "Re: Test Reply",
  "body": {"text": "Test reply from MCP v3.0.1"}
}
```

**Expected**: ✅ Reply sent successfully (404 error resolved)

### **Test Case 3: Tool Registration Verification**
```bash
list_tools
```

**Expected**: 
- ✅ `reply_to_email` present
- ❌ `send_email` absent  
- ❌ `campaign_creation_wizard` absent
