# Visual Verification Guide for Instantly Line Break Formatting

## Test Campaigns Created

We have created test campaigns with different formatting approaches. Please check these in the Instantly web interface:

### 1. Current Approach (Plain \n characters)
- **Campaign ID**: `2e59ca64-903f-4595-8812-b10f14fd69f2`
- **Approach**: Plain text with `\n` line breaks
- **Expected Content**:
  ```
  Hi {{firstName}},

  Welcome to our newsletter!

  We have exciting updates:
  ‚Ä¢ Feature 1
  ‚Ä¢ Feature 2
  ‚Ä¢ Feature 3

  Best regards,
  The Team
  ```

### 2. HTML Paragraph Approach (Potentially Best)
- **Campaign ID**: `a260d3b4-a4ec-4938-abbd-4aff9163d2c5`
- **Approach**: HTML `<p>` paragraph tags
- **Expected Content**: Same content but with proper HTML paragraph formatting

## Visual Verification Steps

### Step 1: Check Campaign List
1. Log into Instantly web interface
2. Navigate to Campaigns section
3. Look for campaigns named:
   - "Direct API Test: Plain \n Characters"
   - "Direct API Test: HTML Paragraphs"

### Step 2: Examine Email Editor
For each campaign:
1. Click on the campaign to open it
2. Go to the "Sequences" tab
3. Click on "Step 1" to view the email
4. Check how the email body appears in the editor

### Step 3: Test Email Preview
1. Click "Preview" button in the email editor
2. Check if line breaks are visually rendered as paragraph separations
3. Note any differences between the two approaches

### Step 4: Visual Quality Assessment
Rate each approach on:
- **Line Break Visibility**: Are paragraph breaks clearly visible?
- **Content Readability**: Is the content easy to read?
- **Professional Appearance**: Does it look professional?
- **Editing Experience**: Is it easy to edit in the interface?

## Expected Results

### If Plain \n Approach Shows Good Visual Separation:
- ‚úÖ Keep current implementation
- ‚úÖ Current HTML validation is correct
- ‚úÖ No changes needed to MCP tool

### If Plain \n Approach Shows Poor Visual Separation:
- üîÑ Consider implementing HTML paragraph support
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Would require removing HTML validation
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Need to add proper HTML paragraph conversion logic

### If HTML Paragraph Approach Shows Excellent Rendering:
- üéØ Strong candidate for implementation
- üìù Would need to update `buildCampaignPayload` function
- üìù Would need to remove HTML validation for paragraph tags

## Implementation Decision Matrix

| Visual Quality | Plain \n | HTML \p | Recommendation |
|----------------|----------|---------|----------------|
| Both Good | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ | Keep current (simpler) |
| Plain Good, HTML Better | ‚úÖ | ‚≠ê | Consider HTML upgrade |
| Plain Poor, HTML Good | ‚ùå | ‚úÖ | Implement HTML paragraphs |
| Both Poor | ‚ùå | ‚ùå | Investigate other options |

## Next Steps Based on Results

### If keeping current approach:
1. Document that visual rendering is acceptable
2. Keep HTML validation in place
3. Update documentation to clarify line break behavior

### If implementing HTML paragraphs:
1. Update `buildCampaignPayload` to convert `\n\n` to `<p>` tags
2. Remove HTML validation for paragraph tags specifically
3. Add comprehensive testing
4. Update tool documentation

## Test Campaign Details

The test campaigns contain identical content but with different formatting:

**Content Structure:**
- Greeting with personalization
- Welcome message
- Bulleted list of features
- Professional closing

**Line Break Patterns Tested:**
- Single line breaks (`\n`)
- Double line breaks (`\n\n`) for paragraphs
- Mixed content with lists

Please check both campaigns and report back on the visual quality differences!
